# Customer Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the code and tools for analyzing customer sentiment from feedback data. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the project helps businesses and organizations understand their customersâ€™ emotions, opinions, and feedback trends. It uses advanced models to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, and provides insights into the emotional tone of customer interactions.

## Features
  * Text Analysis: Extract sentiment from customer reviews, survey responses, social media mentions, and more.
  * Sentiment Classification: Automatically classify feedback into categories (e.g., positive, negative).
  * Real-Time Feedback Analysis: Integrate with live customer data to perform real-time sentiment analysis (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
  * Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis using Python libraries like NLTK, or transformers.
  * Machine Learning Models: Decision Tree Classifier
  * Web Scraping/Integration: For gathering customer feedback from various sources (e.g., social media, review sites).
  * API Integrations: If integrated with a web platform, APIs can be used to pull live customer feedback and sentiment data.

## How It Works
  * Data Collection: Gather feedback from various channels such as surveys, customer reviews, social media, or support tickets.
  * Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing text.
  * Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP techniques or machine learning models to determine the sentiment and emotional tone of each feedback entry.
  * Reporting: Generate insights from the sentiment data, including overall sentiment trends, specific issues causing dissatisfaction, and potential opportunities for improvement.
  * Actionable Insights: Turn the sentiment data into actionable insights for marketing, customer support, and product improvement teams.

## Use Cases
  * Customer Support: Automatically classify and prioritize customer complaints based on sentiment, allowing quicker response to negative feedback.
  * Product Development: Track customer satisfaction and identify pain points or areas for improvement.
  * Brand Monitoring: Analyze customer sentiment across social media and online platforms to monitor brand health and reputation.
  * Market Research: Use sentiment analysis to gauge customer reactions to new products, marketing campaigns, or features.
